        Today I have no energy. Due to me deciding to cook and make a mess I was left with a big mess that I had to clean.Therefore I went on a tangent of cleaning the whole house.

        Dear blog Today my kid made me almost rip my hair out. Riding home there was a detour that lead us to the same road Mcdonalds is on leaving her to want to go. After telling her no she threw a tantrum so bad that she started to yell as if she was a banshee.
